======================
Source for my GymChecker app. http://gymchecker.reecedenne.com

## Original Repo

This Node.js application is based on the [eb-node-express-signup](https://github.com/awslabs/eb-node-express-signup) repo from AWSLabs.

## Concept

The concept of this app is that users add their login details to their online gym account (just [PureGym](http://puregym.com) for now) and then they can see the historical capacity of their home gym.

They can then use this information to plan their gym attendance based on if they like to go during quiet periods or if they like to go when it's busy.

In terms of functionality - the graphing and alerting hasn't been added yet.
